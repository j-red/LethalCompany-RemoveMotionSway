# Remove Motion Sway 

A client-side mod to remove the camera head bobbing/motion sway while walking or running in Lethal Company. Also removes the helmet visor from the HUD overlay to further clean up the visual experience. Has additional support to toggle the FOV lock or set a specific FOV for use in the game, as well as control the intensity of motion sway via configuration instead of disabling it entirely.

## Compatibility

May be incompatible with mods that tweak the default camera field of view (FOV). A configuration setting to toggle the FOV lock has been added in v1.2.0 and can be edited in the BepInEx/Config/jred.RemoveMotionSway.cfg file or through your mod manager of choice. 

Should be compatible with all other mods unless they modify the way the camera works! Built with BepInEx 5.4.22, tested and functional on v5.4.21. Limited multiplayer testing -- if you notice a bug, please report it through the GitHub link below!

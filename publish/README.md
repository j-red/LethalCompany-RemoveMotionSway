# Remove Motion Sway 

A client-side mod to remove the camera head bobbing/motion sway while walking or running in Lethal Company. Also removes the helmet visor from the HUD overlay to further clean up the visual experience.

Should be compatible with all other mods unless they modify the way the camera works! Built with BepInEx 5.4.22, tested and functional on v5.4.21. Only tested with two players in multiplayer, but should be compatible with mods that allow additional players as well.
